# Notes
## do
- clean up collision detection
  - Simplify! test collisions with 2 enemies, get it right, then move on to 3 enemies.
  - display masks instead of sprites
  - add rectangle outlines
  - display the mask collision overlap mask, with a different color
  - loop over enemies
    if current enemy is colliding with any other enemies
      +-1 from x/y of current enemy
      check if current enemy is colliding
        if so, +-1 from x/y until collision is no longer detected
- have enemies move down from top of screen
- provide indicator when power up acquired
- give enemies move sets

### polishing stuff
- make explosions of enemies whose color and effects should be dependent on what was destroyed
